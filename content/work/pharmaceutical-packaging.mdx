## Overview

A complete sterile environment automation system for high-volume pharmaceutical packaging operations. This project demanded the highest standards of precision, cleanliness, and regulatory compliance while dramatically increasing throughput capacity.

## The Challenge

Pharmaceutical packaging presents unique challenges that require specialized expertise:

- **Sterility requirements** demanding ISO Class 5 cleanroom compliance
- **Regulatory compliance** with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements
- **Absolute accuracy** with zero tolerance for mislabeling or contamination
- **Traceability** requiring complete batch genealogy
- **Validation** with extensive IQ/OQ/PQ protocols

<Callout type="warning" title="Regulatory Stakes">
In pharmaceutical manufacturing, a single packaging error can trigger FDA enforcement actions, product recalls, and patient safety risks worth hundreds of millions in liability.
</Callout>

## Our Solution

We engineered a comprehensive packaging automation system designed specifically for pharmaceutical-grade operations:

### Cleanroom-Compliant Robotics

- **Stainless steel construction** with electropolished surfaces
- **Sealed joints** preventing particle generation
- **Clean-in-place (CIP)** compatible design
- **Hydrogen peroxide vapor** decontamination capability

### Vision-Guided Precision Placement

Our vision systems ensure absolute accuracy:

- **360° inspection** of every unit before packaging
- **OCR verification** of lot numbers and expiration dates
- **Barcode validation** cross-referenced with batch records
- **Cosmetic defect detection** with sub-millimeter resolution

### Automated Quality Verification

Quality is verified at multiple checkpoints:

- **Weight verification** to ±0.01 gram accuracy
- **Seal integrity testing** using vacuum decay methods
- **Label placement verification** within 0.5mm tolerance
- **Tamper-evident feature** confirmation

### Integrated Traceability

Complete electronic batch records capture:

- **Component lot numbers** for every ingredient
- **Equipment identification** for all processing steps
- **Operator actions** with electronic signatures
- **Environmental conditions** throughout production

<Callout type="info" title="Data Integrity">
The system generates over 50,000 data points per batch, all cryptographically signed and stored in compliance with ALCOA+ principles for data integrity.
</Callout>

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Design & Validation Planning
- Risk assessment and FMEA analysis
- URS development with quality team
- Vendor qualification protocols

### Phase 2: Factory Acceptance Testing
- Complete system testing at our facility
- Simulated production runs
- Documentation review with QA

### Phase 3: Installation & Commissioning
- Cleanroom installation protocols
- Environmental qualification
- Equipment calibration

### Phase 4: Validation Execution
- IQ/OQ/PQ protocol execution
- Process validation batches
- Regulatory submission package

## Results

The system exceeded all performance targets:

- **99.9% accuracy** rate in packaging operations
- **5x throughput** increase versus manual operations
- **Zero contamination** incidents since go-live
- **Full regulatory compliance** across all markets
- **50% reduction** in documentation effort through automation

<Callout type="success" title="FDA Inspection">
The facility successfully passed an FDA pre-approval inspection with zero observations related to the new packaging systems.
