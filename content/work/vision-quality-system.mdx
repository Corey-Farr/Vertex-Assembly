## Overview

A deep learning-powered visual inspection system deployed across critical aerospace component manufacturing, capable of detecting defects invisible to human inspectors while maintaining production-line speeds.

## The Challenge

Aerospace manufacturing has zero tolerance for defects:

- **Safety-critical components** where failures cost lives
- **Microscopic defects** smaller than human visual acuity
- **50+ defect categories** requiring simultaneous detection
- **100% inspection** mandated by aerospace regulations
- **Speed requirements** matching 6-second takt time

<Callout type="warning" title="Stakes of Failure">
A single undetected defect in an aerospace component can ground entire aircraft fleets, costing airlines millions per day and potentially endangering passengers.
</Callout>

## Our Solution

We developed a comprehensive AI-powered inspection platform:

### Multi-Modal Imaging

Different defect types require different imaging approaches:

- **High-resolution visible light** for surface defects
- **Infrared thermography** for subsurface anomalies
- **Structured light 3D** for dimensional verification
- **UV fluorescence** for crack detection

### Deep Learning Detection

Our neural network architecture achieves superhuman detection:

- **Custom CNN architecture** optimized for industrial inspection
- **Transfer learning** from 10M+ annotated defect images
- **Real-time inference** completing analysis in &lt;100ms
- **Continuous learning** improving from production data

### Defect Classification

The system categorizes across 50+ defect types:

- **Surface defects**: scratches, pits, inclusions, discoloration
- **Dimensional defects**: warpage, out-of-tolerance features
- **Structural defects**: cracks, porosity, delamination
- **Assembly defects**: missing features, incorrect orientation

<Callout type="info" title="Human Augmentation">
The system doesn't replace human inspectors but augments them, flagging potential issues for human review while ensuring nothing escapes detection.
</Callout>

### Operator Interface

Inspectors interact through an intuitive interface:

- **Highlighted defect regions** with confidence scores
- **Defect classification** with reference examples
- **One-click acceptance/rejection** workflow
- **Audit trail** for every inspection decision
